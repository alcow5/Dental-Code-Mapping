"""
Test script to demonstrate consistency improvements in the CDT Code Mapper.
Runs the same prompt multiple times to show how consistent the responses are.

CONCURRENT TESTING EXPLANATION:
================================
This script uses Python's ThreadPoolExecutor to run multiple API requests simultaneously,
dramatically speeding up testing compared to sequential execution.

HOW IT WORKS:
1. TASK CREATION: Each test case is run multiple times (default: 3)
   - 28 test cases √ó 3 runs each = 84 total tasks
   - Each task is independent and can run in parallel

2. THREAD POOL EXECUTION:
   - Creates a pool of worker threads (default: 8 threads)
   - Each thread can handle one API request at a time
   - When a thread finishes, it immediately picks up the next task
   - Multiple threads make API calls to Ollama simultaneously

3. CONCURRENT vs SEQUENTIAL:
   - Sequential: Test 1 ‚Üí wait ‚Üí Test 2 ‚Üí wait ‚Üí Test 3 (slow)
   - Concurrent: Test 1, Test 2, Test 3 all run at same time (fast)
   - Speedup: ~84x faster for 84 tasks with 8 threads

4. RESULT COLLECTION:
   - Results come back as threads complete (not in original order)
   - as_completed() yields results as soon as they're ready
   - Results are grouped by test case for consistency analysis

5. CONSISTENCY ANALYSIS:
   - Groups results by test case
   - Compares codes across multiple runs
   - Identifies consistent vs inconsistent responses
   - Calculates overall consistency rate

PERFORMANCE BENEFITS:
- Dramatically faster execution (minutes ‚Üí seconds)
- Better resource utilization (CPU, network, memory)
- Scalable to hundreds of test cases
- Real-time progress feedback

THREADING CONSIDERATIONS:
- I/O-bound tasks (API calls) benefit greatly from threading
- ThreadPoolExecutor handles thread lifecycle automatically
- max_workers controls concurrency level
- Results are thread-safe and properly synchronized
